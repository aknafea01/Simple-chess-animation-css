# Simple Chess Animation with CSS

This project demonstrates a simple chessboard animation created using only HTML and CSS. The goal is to showcase a basic chessboard layout and animate the pieces in a simple and visually appealing manner using CSS keyframes and transitions.
## Notices
I didn't use responsive so it may not appear as was designed.
## Project Structure

The project includes the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file, which contains the structure of the chessboard and the chess pieces.
- `style.css`: The CSS file used for styling the chessboard, pieces, and animations.
- `assets/`: Contains any images or resources used for the chess pieces (if applicable).

## Features

- A simple chessboard layout created with CSS Grid.
- CSS animations for the chess pieces.
- No JavaScript was used, purely CSS for animation effects.
